# Pre-Academic-Year-Student-Learning
Week 1:  learned the basic of git 
Wee  2: Went to youtube and learned about variables and functions, then completed my CS50 Week0 Learning content and task.
Week 3: Had to familiarise myself with conditions, then went on to complete my WEEk1 CS50 tasks, it was challenging a bit, but very doable. The CS50 tasks are the ones that showed me a little bit of resistance, since the tasks are tricky, but i managed to complete all.

Week 4: Learning loops, this is where i found myself very challenged, i had to re-educate myself over and over just to get the basics of it. I still need to do more work on loops both the while and for loop.

Week 5: Things are starting to get realy tough. . . we`ll see by the ned of the week

...................................................................................................................................

Resources i used: Mostly i use youtube videos, i dont really take the cs50 leassons 
Challenges: Solving problems without consulting some for of help tools or youtube videos, i still need to work on mastering the art of solving tasks witout any help, getting close but it still challenging tho`. I need to complete the git tasks. 

Expectations: Getting good at loops and solving tasks without any help, plan on redoin the tasks i did or new ones over and over again. Try and and catch up with the learning content for cs50, but firstly i will need to go back and relearn what i`ve alread learnt.
